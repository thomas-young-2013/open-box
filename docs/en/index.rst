OpenBox: Generalized and Efficient Blackbox Optimization System
###############################################################

**OpenBox** is an efficient open-source system designed for **solving
generalized black-box optimization (BBO) problems**, such as
`automatic hyper-parameter tuning <./examples/single_objective_hpo.html>`__,
automatic A/B testing, experimental design, database knob tuning,
processor architecture and circuit design,
resource allocation, automatic chemical design, etc.

The design of **OpenBox** follows the philosophy of providing **"BBO as a service"** - we
opt to implement **OpenBox** as a distributed, fault-tolerant, scalable, and efficient service,
with a wide range of application scope, stable performance across problems
and advantages such as ease of use, portability, and zero maintenance.

There are two ways to use **OpenBox**:
`Standalone python package <./installation/installation_guide.html>`__
and `Online BBO service <./openbox_as_service/service_introduction.html>`__.


------------------------------------------------

Who should consider using OpenBox
---------------------------------

-  Those who want to **tune hyper-parameters** for their ML tasks
   automatically.

-  Those who want to **find the optimal configuration** for their
   configuration search tasks (e.g., database knob tuning).

-  Data platform owners who want to **provide BBO service in their
   platform**.

-  Researchers and data scientists who want to **solve
   generalized BBO problems easily**.

OpenBox capabilities
--------------------------------------

OpenBox has a wide range of functionality scope, which includes:

1. BBO with any number of objectives and constraints.

2. BBO with transfer learning.

3. BBO with distributed parallelization.

4. BBO with multi-fidelity acceleration.

5. BBO with early stops.

In the following, we provide a taxonomy of existing BBO systems:

============== ========== ==== ========== ======= ===========
System/Package Multi-obj. FIOC Constraint History Distributed
============== ========== ==== ========== ======= ===========
Hyperopt       ×          √    ×          ×       √
Spearmint      ×          ×    √          ×       ×
SMAC3          ×          √    ×          ×       ×

GPflowOPT      √          ×    √          ×       ×

**OpenBox**    √          √    √          √       √
============== ========== ==== ========== ======= ===========

-  **FIOC**: Support different input variable types, including
   Float, Integer, Ordinal and Categorical.

-  **Multi-obj.**: Support optimizing multiple objectives.

-  **Constraint**: Support inequality constraints.

-  **History**: Support injecting prior knowledge from previous
   tasks into the current search. (△ means the system cannot support
   it for general cases)

-  **Distributed**: Support parallel evaluations in a distributed
   environment.

Installation
------------

Please refer to our `Installation
Guide <./installation/installation_guide.html>`__.

------------------------------------------------

Quick Start
-----------

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from openbox.utils.config_space import ConfigurationSpace, UniformFloatHyperparameter
    from openbox.optimizer.generic_smbo import SMBO

    # Define Configuration Space
    config_space = ConfigurationSpace()
    x1 = UniformFloatHyperparameter("x1", -5, 10, default_value=0)
    x2 = UniformFloatHyperparameter("x2", 0, 15, default_value=0)
    config_space.add_hyperparameters([x1, x2])

    # Define Objective Function
    def branin(config):
        x1, x2 = config['x1'], config['x2']
        y = (x2-5.1/(4*np.pi**2)*x1**2+5/np.pi*x1-6)**2+10*(1-1/(8*np.pi))*np.cos(x1)+10
        return y

    # Run
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        bo = SMBO(branin, config_space, max_runs=50, task_id='quick_start')
        history = bo.run()
        print(history)
